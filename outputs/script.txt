INT. BARNABY'S CAVE - DAY

A spotless cave. HONEY POTS are lined up perfectly. BARNABY BEAR (friendly, tidy) brushes his fur until it gleams.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Barnaby the Bear was the tidiest bear in the whole wide world!

BARNABY
(Smiling)
Everything in its place!

EXT. FOREST - DAY

BARNABY walks through the forest to FINLEY'S DEN.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
His best friend, Finley the Fox, wasn’t quite as tidy.

EXT. FINLEY'S DEN - DAY

FINLEY'S DEN is a mess. Toys, berries, leaves are scattered everywhere. FINLEY FOX (playful, messy) is building a tower of acorns.

BARNABY
(Entering, a little strained)
Finley, perhaps we could put these blocks away?

FINLEY
(Shrugging)
But Barnaby, I might need them later! It’s more fun playing!

EXT. FINLEY'S DEN - LATER

BARNABY, armed with a broom, marches to Finley’s den.

BARNABY
(Determined)
Finley, I am going to tidy your den!

FINLEY
(Startled)
But Barnaby! I don’t want you to!

BARNABY
It’s so messy! How can you find anything?

FINLEY
I know where everything is! More or less.

Barnaby starts sweeping leaves and toys. FINLEY watches, worried.

DISASTER! Barnaby accidentally sweeps away the base of Finley’s acorn tower.

FINLEY
(Bursting into tears)
My tower! You ruined my tower!

Barnaby kneels, trying to help, but the acorns are mixed with the mess.

BARNABY
(Sad)
I’m so sorry, Finley. I just wanted to help.

FINLEY
(Sniffling)
I know… but maybe my den isn’t so bad after all.

Barnaby looks around. It’s still messy.

BARNABY
You know what, Finley? Maybe we should just play.

FINLEY
(Face brightens)
Okay!

They play hide-and-seek in the messy den. Barnaby gets a little messy too.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Barnaby learned that friendship is more important than being tidy.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Barnaby and Finley walk side-by-side.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
And sometimes, a little mess is okay.

FADE OUT.
