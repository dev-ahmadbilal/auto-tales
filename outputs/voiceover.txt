**INT. BARNABY'S CAVE - DAY**

**(Sound of gentle sweeping and things being neatly placed)**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** (Warm, friendly, and slightly whimsical) Barnaby the Bear was the tidiest bear in the whole wide world!

**BARNABY:** (Cheerful, slightly higher-pitched, very precise) (Smiling) Everything in its place! Ahhh, perfect!

**EXT. FOREST - DAY**

**(Sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling)**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** (Warm, friendly, and slightly whimsical) His best friend, Finley the Fox, wasn’t quite as tidy.

**EXT. FINLEY'S DEN - DAY**

**(Sound of playful chatter and acorns clattering)**

**BARNABY:** (Entering, a little strained, slightly higher-pitched) Finley, perhaps we could put these blocks away?

**FINLEY:** (Shrugging, energetic, slightly raspy, quick) But Barnaby, I might need them later! (Grinning mischievously) It’s more fun playing! Whee!

**EXT. FINLEY'S DEN - LATER**

**(Sound of determined footsteps)**

**BARNABY:** (Determined, firm, slightly higher-pitched) Finley, I am going to tidy your den!

**FINLEY:** (Startled, surprised, slightly raspy, a little whiny) But Barnaby! I don’t want you to!

**BARNABY:** (Slightly exasperated, but still friendly) It’s so messy! How can you find anything?

**FINLEY:** (Playful, slightly raspy, quick) I know where everything is! More or less. (Giggles)

**(Sound of sweeping, a CRASH, and scattering acorns)**

**FINLEY:** (Bursting into tears, very upset, slightly raspy) My tower! You ruined my tower! (Sobbing)

**BARNABY:** (Sad, apologetic, slightly higher-pitched, gentle) I’m so sorry, Finley. I just wanted to help.

**FINLEY:** (Sniffling, quiet, then brightening, slightly raspy) I know… but maybe… maybe my den isn’t so bad after all.

**BARNABY:** (Thoughtful, then cheerful, slightly higher-pitched) You know what, Finley? Maybe we should just play.

**FINLEY:** (Face brightens, excited, slightly raspy) Okay! (Giggles)

**(Sound of playful running and laughter)**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** (Warm, friendly, and slightly whimsical) Barnaby learned that friendship is more important than being tidy.

**EXT. FOREST - DAY**

**(Sound of gentle walking)**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** (Warm, friendly, and slightly whimsical) And sometimes, a little mess is okay.

**(Sound of happy sighing and gentle music fading out)**
